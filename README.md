# React Observatory

Code-split everything.

## Prerequisites

React Observable can be used to it's full potential in projects that rely on [redux,](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) [redux-observable](https://github.com/redux-observable/redux-observable/) and [react-loadable](https://github.com/jamiebuilds/react-loadable) or any other way for code-splitting.

## Installation

To install the stable version:

```
npm install --save react-observatory
```

## Thanks

* [react-boilerplate](https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate) for a good idea on how to inject reducers and sagas dynamically;
* [react-observable](https://redux-observable.js.org/) for enabling declarative side-effects in Redux architecture;
* [react-loadable](https://github.com/jamiebuilds/react-loadable) fro beautiful code-splitting on component level.
