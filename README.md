## Thanks

* [redux](https://redux.js.org/) for enabling better architectures.
* [react-boilerplate](https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate) for a good idea on how to inject reducers and sagas dynamically;
* [react-observable](https://redux-observable.js.org/) for enabling declarative side-effects in Redux architecture;
* [react-loadable](https://github.com/jamiebuilds/react-loadable) for beautiful code-splitting on component level.
